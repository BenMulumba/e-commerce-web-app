Django E-Commerce Web Application
This project aims to develop a fully responsive e-commerce web application using the Django framework in Python.
The goal is to create a robust and user-friendly platform for online shopping.

Getting Started
Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

Step 1: Create a Virtual Environment

# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate the virtual environment
# On Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate
Step 2: Install Django
While the virtual environment is activated, install Django using pip:


pip install django
Step 3: Create a Django Project
Create a Django project. Replace "myproject" with your desired project name:


django-admin startproject myproject
Step 4: Navigate to the Project Directory
Change to the project directory:


cd myproject
Step 5: Create a Django App
Create a Django app within your project. Replace "myapp" with your desired app name:


python manage.py startapp myapp
Step 6: Register the App in Settings
Open the myproject/settings.py file and add your app to the INSTALLED_APPS list:


INSTALLED_APPS = [
    # ...
    'myapp',
    # ...
]
Step 7: Define a Simple View
Open the myapp/views.py file and define a simple view:


from django.http import HttpResponse

def hello(request):
    return HttpResponse("Hello, Django!")
Step 8: Create a URL Configuration for the App
Create a file named urls.py inside your app directory (myapp). Define the URL pattern for the hello view:


from django.urls import path
from .views import hello

urlpatterns = [
    path('hello/', hello, name='hello'),
]
Step 9: Include the App's URLs in the Project's URLs
Open the myproject/urls.py file and include the URLs of your app:


from django.contrib import admin
from django.urls import include, path

urlpatterns = [
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
    path('myapp/', include('myapp.urls')),
]
Step 10: Run the Development Server
Finally, run the development server:


python manage.py runserver
Open your browser and go to http://localhost:8000/myapp/hello/. You should see the message "Hello, Django!"

That's it! You've successfully created a virtual environment, installed Django, created a project, added an app, defined a view, configured URLs, and run your first Django app.
